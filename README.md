# Clickmap

Clickmap is an angular directive that I am working on for a website I am building.

Clickmaps are interactive maps that users can create and edit to provide notations on images. It is specifically designed to add icons with descriptions to maps.

The version I am currently working on is designed to be used for guides for video games.
